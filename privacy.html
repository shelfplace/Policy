                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy describes how ShelfPlace ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
                    your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>
                <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. ShelfPlace is designed to be a local-first digital
                    library experience.</p>

                <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <h3>Personal Data</h3>
                <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII)
                    such as your name, email address, phone number, or location data. ShelfPlace operates without a user
                    account system.</p>

                <h3>Files and Media</h3>
                <p>ShelfPlace requires access to your device's storage to function as a reader.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read Permissions:</strong> We ask for permission to access your device's external
                        storage (<code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>) solely to allow you to select and import PDF and
                        EPUB files into the application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All books, covers, annotations, and metadata are processed
                        and stored locally on your device using a local database usage. We do not upload your files to
                        any external server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Application Data</h3>
                <p>We use local storage (Hive database) to save your:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Library organization (shelves, folders).</li>
                    <li>Reading progress.</li>
                    <li>Bookmarks and annotations.</li>
                    <li>App preferences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data resides entirely on your device and is not accessible by us.</p>

                <h2>2. Network Usage</h2>
                <p>The application has <code>INTERNET</code> permission, which is used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Downloading open-source assets or metadata if initiated by the user.</li>
                    <li>Checking network connectivity status (<code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not use this permission to track user behavior or send data to third-party advertising
                    networks.</p>

                <h2>3. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
                <p>We use open-source libraries to build this application (e.g., for rendering PDFs and EPUBs). These
                    libraries function locally on your device and are not authorized to collect data about you.</p>

                <h2>4. Security</h2>
                <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the
                    internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>
                <p>Since ShelfPlace stores data locally, the security of your library primarily depends on the security
                    of your device itself.</p>

                <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

                <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                    this page.</p>

                <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
